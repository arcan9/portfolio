        Hi, I'm Ashelle (prounounced uh-shell), illustrator turned web
        developer. Like many people, I've dabbled a bit with coding when I was a
        teen. Tweaking HTML and CSS here and there on my Myspace layout and
        Tumble blogs (remember those times?). For years, I worked as a digital
        artist, illustrating custom art and indie published work. It really
        wasn't until I stumbled upon SheCodes, a program that teaches women how
        to code, that I was inspired to get into web developement. As a
        creative, it seemed a perfect opportunity to learn and hone some tech
        skills, solving problems, while creating clean and aesthetically
        pleasing pages. I was hooked.
        <br />
        <br />
        Early 2022, SheCodes has helped me learn and developed projects using
        HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, and API. I'm continuing to learn every
        day. As I've worked independently a good portion of my life, I've always
        aimed to do good work with dogged determination and continue to improve
        myself. That said, I also enjoy working with others whenever interesing
        group-oriented projects land my way. I would love to work with other
        creatives and programmers who value inclusivity, empathy, and friendly
        open communication.
